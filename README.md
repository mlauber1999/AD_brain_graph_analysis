# TAU SUVR Graphical Modeling Project 
In this repository, you will find all the code nessescary to:  
1. Run Graphical LASSO model on Tau SUVR values 
2. Analyze graph level metrics to determine differences between global amyloid quartile groups 

## I. Graphical Model Pipeline 

### Data Processing Steps 





### A. Final Data Paths for CSVs with Tau SUVR Values for Each Centiloid Quartile Group
The file paths to the input data for the graphical models can be found in **mci_mri_graph/Data_paths_and_cleaning/Data** :  
The ADNI data csv for each centiloid quartile will be in **mci_mri_graph/Data_paths_and_cleaning/Data/ADNI**  
The A4 data csv for each centiloid quartile will be in **mci_mri_graph/Data_paths_and_cleaning/Data/A4**  
## II. Analyze Graph Level Metrics
