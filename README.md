# TAU SUVR Graphical Modeling Project 
In this repository, you will find all the code nessescary to:
1. Run Graphical LASSO model on Tau SUVR values 
2. Analyze graph level metrics to determine differences between global amyloid quartile groups 

## I. Graphical Model Pipeline 

### A. Data Paths for CSVs with Tau SUVR Values for Each Centiloid Quartile Group

## II. Analyze Graph Level Metrics
